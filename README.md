# Basic chat app
I have completed this app in couple hours, and it's extremely basic, with lots of things to improve.  
I wanted to test NestJS as backend with MongoDB, and React with Redux, and Typescript... and how fast I can create a real-time chat using Websockets  
Most of the things are hardcoded, and it's in no-way secure at this point.  
The idea was to create a chat that can be used publicly, that saves no data of users, no verifications needed, no censoring, just pure freedom of speech in real-time, with ability to create public rooms (at start), and lots of other high-end features later.
  
There are lots of things that Has to be done like:  
- Add routing guards for logged in users (to not access register page)
- and encryption of messages  
- personalization of profile (color of name, maybe avatar, messages background color, etc)  
- room creation and room search functionality + special encryption key for each room so chat can be encrypted  
- end-to-end encryption of all messages  
- fix styles, navigation, look and feel
- no ability to add links or images in chat (to prevent spam of p**n / or advertisements at least visually)

I don't want to monetize it or anything... I just want to make chill platform where whoever wanna chat about something, can do it super quick, with no registration needed, or any verifications, neither to be afraid that someone will "track him", or anything.  
Main goal is to allow people to just chat, and chill... with random people around the world, maybe share ideas, talk privately in private rooms if they want to, etc.
